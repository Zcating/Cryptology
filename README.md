# Cryptology
#code by Zcating from CUG
#you can add your advance code as you can.


It is a cryptology algorithm.
It contain these algrithm:
    1. affine cipher    (unknown)
    2. Playfair cipher  (1854)
    3. Vigenere cipher  (1858)
    4. Vernam cipher    (1917)
    5. Hill cipher      (1929)
    
  In my code, Hill cipher can only use 2x2 matrix as secret key. 
I have no idea to enhance my code, now.  hope you big bros can 
make the code better. 
  I am trying to write the assemble code, this may not easy, but 
I will try my best.
